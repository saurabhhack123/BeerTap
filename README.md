Once upon a time there was a tavern with 1000 beer taps, numbered from 1 to 1000. You were told by a mysterious stranger that the best beers are the one with the taps whose number matches those 2 conditions:
1) The sum of the divisors (including 1, but not the number itself) of the tap number is greater than tap number itself
2) No subset of those divisors sums up to the tap number itself

The waiter is coming, what is your order?

For example:
- Number 12: the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. The sum is 1+2+3+4+6 = 16 which is greater than 12 and matches the first condition. However, the subset 2+4+6=12 which violates the second condition.
